# TOK ONE

This project is my unfinished renderer and platform abstraction layer. Only Mac OS X is available now

## Terminology in this codebase

I generally try to use full-width english words
and descriptions for clarity, but here is a list
of words so common I do abbreviate them:

- T1 = tok one (the name of this project)
- cur = current
- res = resource
- tex - texture
- img = image
- reg = register
- pos = position
- loc = location
- dir = directory/folder
- mem = memory
- shuf = shuffle
- rand = random
- del = delete

The following are made up words used everywhere:
- "zsprite": An instance of a 3D mesh, (a sprite with a z-axis)
- "zlight": A 3D light
- "texquad": A 2D quad with a texture
- "render view": A view or camera with a texture 
that you can render to.
